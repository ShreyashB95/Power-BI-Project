I am thrilled to share the first Power BI dashboard I have created using the powerful feature known as Power Query. I transformed raw data into valuable insights on employee attrition patterns based on various factors. This project was a great learning experience for me. Understanding employee attrition patterns can help us make data-driven decisions and better utilize our organization's human capital.

The entire process involved the following steps:
1. Data cleaning and processing
2. Setting up the Power BI dashboard
3. Importing data into Power BI
4. Using Power Query
5. Creating DAX measures and calculations
6. Designing charts
7. Applying filters and slicers
8. Creating the dashboard
9. Exporting the dashboard
10. Gaining insights from the dashboard

Insights:
Employee attrition rates are influenced by education, age, job role, salary slab, and years at the company.
